What does "futtetennismo" mean?! A couple of years ago I was reading Bud Spencer's
[Mangio Ergo Sum]() where he among other things describes the philosophy he lived by
for his entire life. That can be summarised into one simple word: "futtet√¨nne".
The word comes from Napoli's dialect and can be loosely translated as "let it be".
The concept is quite simple: focus on the things that really matter in your life
and don't waste time or energy or money with all the other unimportant things.

Taking that motto as an inspiration, "futtetennismo" is my try to talk about things
that I really enjoy in my life, be it tech, learning, music, books or anything
else that excites me right now. Also I hope to be able to connect to other people
so if you enjoy what you read, you want to share your thoughts with me or give me
feedback please feel free to get in touch!
