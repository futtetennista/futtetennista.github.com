		<p>It&#8217;s quite common to invite users to rate an app on Google Play at some point, on one hand it&#8217;s good to know that your users are happy and on the other it&#8217;s a good way to attract new users. It&#8217;s definitely not the only variable in the equation, but I can definitely say that user satisfaction is inversely proportional to the amount of crashes. But bugs are unfortunately something we have to expect as developers, even after testing our apps thoroughly. One thing we probably don&#8217;t want to do, is to ask a user to rate our app just after a crash since we can be reasonably sure that he&#8217;s not going to be too happy about it. How can we make sure that this doesn&#8217;t happen?</p>

<p>When an uncaught exception is thrown, the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.html#uncaughtException(java.lang.Thread,">uncaughtException</a> method of the default <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.html">UncaughtExceptionHandler</a> for that Thread is called. Good news is, you can supply your own <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler.html">UncaughtExceptionHandler</a> using the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/Thread.html#setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(java.lang.Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler)">setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler</a> setter (this is what <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDYQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Facra%2F&amp;ei=kAwBUezwL8_IsgbIvYH4Dg&amp;usg=AFQjCNF1L9fawVNYyKuqqIa7q22TBcL08w&amp;sig2=_FrQnihkSMcsqGUV5XXp1A&amp;bvm=bv.41524429,d.Yms">ACRA</a> and I suppose other libraries like <a href="https://www.crittercism.com/">Crittercism</a> or <a href="https://www.bugsense.com/">BugSense</a> do under the hood). Here is a little snippet of what we do in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qype.radar">Qype app</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomUncaughtExceptionHandlerProxy implements Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler {

    private static CustomUncaughtExceptionHandlerProxy proxy;

    private final boolean enabled;

    private Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler customUncaughtExceptionHandler;

    private CustomUncaughtExceptionHandlerProxy(CustomApplication application) {
        enabled = !application.inDevMode();
        if (enabled) {
            // Save a reference to the current default handler.
            customUncaughtExceptionHandler = Thread.getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler();
            // Set our custom handler as the default one, so that it's first notified when something ugly happens.
            Thread.setDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler(this);
        }
    }

    public static void initialize(CustomApplication application) {
        if (proxy == null) {
            proxy = new CustomUncaughtExceptionHandlerProxy(application);
        }
    }

    public static CustomUncaughtExceptionHandlerProxy getInstance() {
        return proxy;
    }

    @Override
    public void uncaughtException(Thread thread, Throwable ex) {
        if (enabled) {
            if (!preferences.rateAppDialogAlreadyShown()) {
                // reset count only if the 'rate app' dialog hasn't been already shown.
                preferences.resetShowRateAppDialogCountdown();
            }
            // Let the default uncaught exception handler do its job.
            customUncaughtExceptionHandler.uncaughtException(thread, ex);
        } else {
            Thread.getDefaultUncaughtExceptionHandler().uncaughtException(thread, ex);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a typical implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">Proxy design pattern</a>, it&#8217;s pretty straightforward but here&#8217;s a little explanation of how it works. Let&#8217;s say you want to show a &#8220;Rate App&#8221; dialog after n times the app is opened by the user, you would use a counter and increment it each time the launcher Activity is created and it will show the dialog when the value of the counter is exactly n. But if the app crashes and the dialog is yet to be shown, you may want to reset the counter.</p>

			Location on Android&#8230; The Qype Way</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some months ago we released the first stable version of ignition. In this post I explaned how the ignition-location library works and how it&#8217;s possible to include it in an already existing application. This time I&#8217;ll explain how we integrated it in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qype.radar">Qype Android</a> application.</p>

<p>A very typical use case when using our app is to look for a place to eat, drink or go party nearby. In order to display the best places around, the app needs to know the user&#8217;s location, and it needs to know it as quickly as possible - nobody likes to stare at his/her phone for 5 minutes waiting for something to happen right? Ignition-location is pretty good at that but there are a couple of things the Qype app itself must take care of. In particular, when developing our new location manager, we had two requirements in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li>a good trade off between quickness and accuracy is achieved.</li>
<li>battery is not drained.</li>
</ol>


<p>There are two key components in our location logic: one is <code>QypeLocationManager</code>, the other <code>QypeNewLocationHandler</code>. The former contains all the location logic, in particular it takes care of deciding if a location is <em>good enough</em> - I&#8217;ll go back to this in a bit - and if the app should keep requesting location updates, the latter handles UI-related behaviour. For the sake of completeness, there is a third component which is a small interface called QypeLocationAwareActivity implemented by all our location-aware activities.</p>

<p>So what happens when a new location is received? As you already know from the previous post, <code>IgnitedLocationManager</code> invokes the <code>onIgnitedLocationChanged()</code> callback in the current <code>IgnitedActivity</code>. Since we want our logic to be shared across all out location-aware activities, each of them has a reference to an instance of the <code>QypeLocationManager</code> and it invokes a callback on this object each time a new location is returned:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public boolean onIgnitedLocationChanged(Location location) {
    return locationManager.onNewLocation(this, location, lastSearchedLocation);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This callback has got two locations as parameters: the current location and the location used for the last search. I&#8217;ll expain in the next few lines why both are needed. The <code>onNewLocation()</code> callback is the hearth of our location logic, It checks if it&#8217;s the first time the current Activity is making a request - in this case the Activity is probably being created for the first time - and, if that&#8217;s the case, it checks if the current location is not null and if it&#8217;s &#8220;good enough&#8221; or not. If it is, it invokes the <code>onLocationAvailable()</code> callback (defined in the <code>QypeLocationAwareActivity</code> interface) on the <code>Activity</code>, that will perform whatever task it needs to perform, i.e. searching the best nearby places. Here is a code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean onNewLocation(final QypeLocationAwareActivity context, Location newLocation,
        Location lastSearchedLocation) {

    ...

    // Check if the new location is too old, if so wait for a most recent location.
    if (lastSearchedLocation == null) {
        // Delete any pending API request with an old location and send a new request right
        // away using the most up-to-date location.
        if (locationHandler
                .hasMessages(QypeNewLocationHandler.MSG_SEND_REQUEST_USING_UNRELIABLE_LOCATION)) {
            locationHandler
                    .removeMessages(QypeNewLocationHandler.MSG_SEND_REQUEST_USING_UNRELIABLE_LOCATION);
        }
        Activity activity = (Activity) context;
        // Wait some time if the location is too old, but if a new fix doesn't arrive send the
        // request using the location we've got.
        if (isOldLocation(newLocation)) {
            DialogSupport.safeShowDialog(activity, R.id.ign_loc_dialog_wait_for_fix);
            locationHandler.sendEmptyMessageDelayed(
                    QypeNewLocationHandler.MSG_SEND_REQUEST_USING_UNRELIABLE_LOCATION,
                    INTERVAL_SEND_REQUEST_USING_UNRELIABLE_LOCATION);
        } else {
            Dialog waitForLocationDialog = context.getWaitForLocationDialog();
            if (waitForLocationDialog != null &amp;&amp; waitForLocationDialog.isShowing()) {
                activity.dismissDialog(R.id.ign_loc_dialog_wait_for_fix);
            }
            context.onLocationAvailable();
        }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>So when is a location <em>good enough</em>? In this specific case, that simply means fresh enough. You might ask: so it doesn&#8217;t matter if the location is too coarse? Well&#8230;yes and no. Keep in mind the requirements in first point above, the app should return results as quickly as possible. Moreover in a densely populated area, i.e. a city, a location returned by a coarse provider, i.e. the the network provider, is often a good approximation of the current location. I&#8217;ll explain in a bit when accuracy is taken into account.</p>

<p>Going back to the <code>onLocationAvailable()</code> callback, what happens if the location is not <em>good enough</em>? A couple of possible approaches are: waiting for a better location or using this location anyway. Our approach is somewhere in the middle: the app waits for a certain amount of time, 5 seconds, for a new location. If no new location is received, the app sends an API request using the old location. This is a tricky situation: on one hand we don&#8217;t want our users to wait too much before they can get some results, but we&#8217;d like to make sure that they get the best results we can give them. In this particular case we decided to take an optimistic approach and the app sends a request anyway, it can be that a user didn&#8217;t move too much from the last known location saved by the location manager. But the app does a little bit more under the hood. Let&#8217;s jump for a second at the end of this callback:</p>

<pre><code>    ...
    return requestMoreLocationUpdates(newLocation);
}

private boolean requestMoreLocationUpdates(Location newLocation) {
    double accuracy = newLocation.getAccuracy();
    int desiredAccuracy = getDesiredAccuracy();

    // Check if the new location is fresh and accurate enough.
    return isOldLocation(newLocation) || accuracy &gt; desiredAccuracy;
}

private boolean isOldLocation(Location location) {
    long locationTime = location.getTime();
    long timeDiff = getDesiredTimeDifference();
    long desiredTime = System.currentTimeMillis() - timeDiff;
    return locationTime &lt; desiredTime;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#8217;s assume that the location isn&#8217;t either precise or fresh enough, in this case the location manager will keep asking for location updates until it gets a location that is accurate enough. I&#8217;d like to point out something here: in our specific use case, the app doesn&#8217;t need to continuously ask for location updates. If the app finds a location that is fresh and accurate enough, the app will simply stop requesting location updates. The tricky part here is to find a good threshold: if it requires the location to be too accurate this logic will be useless, otherwise the risk is to use really coarse locations and have bad results returned (if, like in our case, the API you&#8217;re using searches for results in an area centered around user&#8217;s location). If you read the previous post you know that the logic that requests a new location is always re-triggered <code>onResume()</code>, so by &#8220;stopping&#8221; I don&#8217;t actually mean that location updates won&#8217;t be requested at any point in the future, but only that as long as the user stays withiin the context of that <code>Activity</code> the location logic will be turned off, saving battery power. This fulfills our second requirement.</p>

<p>If the last location isn&#8217;t either precise or fresh enough, at some point in the future a new location will be returned by one of the available providers. The <code>onNewLocation()</code> callback will be invoked again but in this case the last searched location won&#8217;t be null.</p>

<pre><code>...

} else {
    boolean diffDistanceTooBig = diffDistanceTooBig(newLocation, lastSearchedLocation);
    if (diffDistanceTooBig) {
        boolean hasBetterLocationMessages = locationHandler
                .hasMessages(MSG_BETTER_LOCATION);
        if (!hasBetterLocationMessages) {
            // It's a better location, invite the user to refresh his location
            locationHandler.obtainMessage(MSG_BETTER_LOCATION).sendToTarget();
        } else {
            locationHandler.removeMessages(MSG_BETTER_LOCATION);
            Message msg = locationHandler.obtainMessage(MSG_BETTER_LOCATION);
            locationHandler.sendMessageDelayed(msg,
                    QypeNewLocationHandler.DELAY_SHOW_BETTER_LOCATION_RELOAD_TOOLTIP);
        }
    }
}

...
</code></pre>

<p>The location manager will calculate the distance between the new and the old distance and, if this distance is greater than a defined threshold (in our case this is simply the desired location accuracy), it will send a new message to the location handler. The rationale here is that if the new location doesn&#8217;t differ too much from the old one, it means that the old location wasn&#8217;t that bad and the app doesn&#8217;t need to do anything special (note: it doesn&#8217;t matter how coarse it was!). But if the new location is too far away from the last one, the app will show a reload view that asks the user if he/she wants to reload the results.</p>

<p><img src="images/nearby_results_reload.jpg"></p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is the <code>QypeNewLocationHandler</code> class, which is just a simple implementation of a Handler that takes advantage of delayed messages to show/hide the reload view.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void handleMessage(Message msg) {
    ReloadTooltip reloadTooltip = context.getReloadTooltip();
    switch (msg.what) {
    case MSG_BETTER_LOCATION:
        if (showReloadTooltip(reloadTooltip)) {
            reloadTooltip.setText(R.string.msg_reload_results_on_new_location);
            reloadTooltip.show(true);
            sendEmptyMessageDelayed(MSG_HIDE_RELOAD_TOOLTIP, TIMEOUT_HIDE_RELOAD_TOOLTIP);
            reloadTooltip.setTag(System.currentTimeMillis());
            hasBetterLocation = false;
        } else if (context.isLoadingData()) {
            hasBetterLocation = true;
        }
        break;
    case MSG_HIDE_RELOAD_TOOLTIP:
        reloadTooltip.hide(true);
        break;
    case MSG_SEND_REQUEST_USING_UNRELIABLE_LOCATION:
        Dialog waitForLocationDialog = context.getWaitForLocationDialog();
        if (waitForLocationDialog != null &amp;&amp; waitForLocationDialog.isShowing()) {
            ((Activity) context).dismissDialog(R.id.ign_loc_dialog_wait_for_fix);
        }
        context.onLocationAvailable();
        break;
    default:
        super.handleMessage(msg);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing special here, apart from a tweak we added while we were testing the app that prevents the reload view from being shown too often and becoming annoying for the user.</p>

			Ignition v0.1 - the Ignited Way of Doing Location</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Today as part of our Fun Friday we released version 0.1 of <a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition">ignition</a>, an Android library that should make your life as an Android developer much less painful. What I&#8217;d like to write about here is the module I focused on, that is the ignition-location module.</p>

<p>Personally I started working with Android almost 3 years ago, in Android terms that means Android v1.5 - Cupcake - API level 3. It wasn&#8217;t easy to understand the framework back then, lots of documentation was missing and I spent hours digging in the source code to understand of things were supposed to work. A lot has changed since 1.5, and developing Android applications has become way easier with better documented APIs and better tools.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit weird that on Android I always worked on location-aware applications, and sadly if you have to deal with location your life is not that simple. I was literally thrilled when I watched <a href="http://www.google.com/events/io/2011/sessions/android-protips-advanced-topics-for-expert-android-app-developers.html">Reto Meier&#8217;s talk on the last Google I/O</a>, read his blog posts - on the <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/06/deep-dive-into-location.html">Android Developers Blog</a>, and on his personal blog (<a href="http://blog.radioactiveyak.com/2011/06/how-to-build-location-based-apps-that.html">1</a>, <a href="http://blog.radioactiveyak.com/2011/06/deep-dive-into-location-part-2-being.html">2</a>), and had a look at his <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cts=1331302043597&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fandroid-protips-location%2F&amp;ei=mA5aT8uzOYHStAaryvGZDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEr7Ee0hLkpQ4-fC8eNw1sEAVqDkA">android-protips-location</a> project - because he showcased some really cool techniques and gave solutions to a lot of issues that I personally experienced. One issue about the sample project is that it&#8217;s not intented to be used as an Android library, so there is no easy way to integrate and all that code, and it&#8217;s a lot of code (but fair enough, that project wasn&#8217;t intented to be an Android library). So I started to think how that code could be reused.</p>

<p>At that time I was working on integrating Analytics in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qype.radar">Qype application</a>(<a href="http://prezi.com/swcxu2ynsio-/implementing-analytics-with-aspectj/">here</a>&#8217;s a prezi of a barcamp session I did during the last DroidCon in London) using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AspectJ">AspectJ</a>, and I really liked its unintrusiveness. That&#8217;s when I thought: it would be awesome if I wouldn&#8217;t had to be worried about enabling/disabling location updates, battery consumption and other details while I&#8217;m developing a location-aware application, I just want to know the most recent known location and I don&#8217;t care about all those things! In other words, the logic that handles location should be a separate concern with respect to the logic of the application (i.e.: getting the best places nearby, the nearby checked-in friends etc.).</p>

<p>After spending several months adapting the <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cts=1331302043597&amp;ved=0CCcQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.google.com%2Fp%2Fandroid-protips-location%2F&amp;ei=mA5aT8uzOYHStAaryvGZDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEr7Ee0hLkpQ4-fC8eNw1sEAVqDkA">android-protips-location</a> project and adding a couple of features so that it could be used as an Android library, here is the final result:</p>

<pre><code>@IgnitedLocationActivity
public class IgnitedLocationSampleActivity extends MapActivity {
    // MUST BE OVERRIDDEN OR IGNITION LOCATION WON'T WORK!
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        ...
    }

    // MUST BE OVERRIDDEN OR IGNITION LOCATION WON'T WORK!
    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
    }

    // MUST BE OVERRIDDEN OR IGNITION LOCATION WON'T WORK!
    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
    }

    @Override
    public boolean onIgnitedLocationChanged(Location newLocation) {
        ...
        return true;
    }
    ...
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Et voilà ! That&#8217;s all the code you have to write in your location-aware Activity! Under the hood the ignition-location library will:</p>

<ul>
<li>enable/disable location updates</li>
<li>enable/disable passive location updates</li>
<li>return the most recent location to your application (using the <code>onIgnitedLocationChanged()</code> callback or a Location <u>field</u> with the <code>@IgnitedLocation</code> annotation)</li>
<li>avoid using GPS if the battery level is too low</li>
<li>automatically switch off GPS and request network updates if a location fix is not returned after a certain interval
without the need for you to do anything else apart from adding the <code>@IgnitedLocation</code>Activity annotation to your Activity and make sure you override <code>onCreate()</code>, <code>onResume()</code> and <code>onPause()</code>. Many configuration parameters can be passed to the <code>@IgnitedLocation</code> Activity annotation to have fully customized settings.</li>
</ul>


<p>If Eclipse is your IDE, additionally to your Android setup you must:</p>

<ol>
<li>download and install the <a href="http://www.google.de/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cts=1331303317995&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eclipse.org%2Fajdt%2F&amp;ei=lBNaT6D6BofhtQb2wvH6Cw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFDAcExHcXf900Zhjp4pcFF0VexHg">ajdt</a></li>
<li>add ignition-location as a library project (have a look <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject">here</a> for instructions)</li>
<li>add ignition-location to the aspect path (have a look at the image below)</li>
</ol>


<p>If you are using Maven as your build manager you have to:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>add ignition-location as a dependency</p>

<p> <dependency>
   <groupId>com.github.ignition</groupId>
   <artifactId>ignition-location</artifactId>
   <version>0.1</version>
   <type>apklib</type>
   <exclusions></p>

<pre><code> &lt;exclusion&gt;
   &lt;groupId&gt;com.google.guava&lt;/groupId&gt;
   &lt;artifactId&gt;guava-collections&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 &lt;/exclusion&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>   </exclusions>
 </dependency></p></li>
<li><p>add the aspectj-maven-plugin to your POM file, adding the ignition-location library to the aspect path</p>

<p> <plugin>
   <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId></p>

<pre><code> &lt;artifactId&gt;aspectj-maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
 &lt;configuration&gt;
   &lt;aspectLibraries&gt;
     &lt;aspectLibrary&gt;
       &lt;groupId&gt;com.github.ignition&lt;/groupId&gt;
       &lt;artifactId&gt;ignition-location&lt;/artifactId&gt;
       &lt;type&gt;apklib&lt;/type&gt;
     &lt;/aspectLibrary&gt;
   &lt;/aspectLibraries&gt;
   &lt;source&gt;1.6&lt;/source&gt;
 &lt;/configuration&gt;
 &lt;executions&gt;
   &lt;execution&gt;
   &lt;!-- phase need to be before compile, or the build will fail. More info here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2610633/maven-compile-aspectj-project-containing-java-1-6-source --&gt;
   &lt;phase&gt;process-sources&lt;/phase&gt;
   &lt;goals&gt;
     &lt;goal&gt;compile&lt;/goal&gt;
   &lt;/goals&gt;
 &lt;/execution&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>   </executions>
 </plugin></p></li>
</ol>


<p>One last good thing about it is that it&#8217;s open source and on <a href="https://github.com/mttkay/ignition">github</a>! So fork it and help us make it better.</p>

<p>NOTE:</p>

<p>If you are wondering if the ignition-location magic will slow your application down, the simple answer is: no. Reflection is not used, AspectJ&#8217;s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7646097/what-is-aspectj-context-binding">Context binding</a> is used instead. That means that all the magic is happening at compile time. Isn&#8217;t that cool?</p>
