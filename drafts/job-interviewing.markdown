title: My journey in the jungle of job interviewing for tech companies
---

I've been looking for a new position for a few months now with honestly poor
results so far. I am keeping notes on all significant interactions with companies
that I had so far and I am trying my best to analyse the process of applying to a
job from a distance, as if I was observing somebody else. This is my personal
attempt to put that effort in a written form, I don't mean for it to be meaningful
for anybody else but myself but I do hope to get some feedback to improve the
way I approach the whole process and that possibly somebody else might find this
somehow useful.
